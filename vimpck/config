#example vimpck configuration file
#color scheme should go under "pack/*/opt"
#filetype plugin should go under "pack/*/start" unless you have more than one plugin for a filetype and want to chose which one to use depending on a condition.
#Maybe I can lazyload some plugin with the packadd mechanism ?

#The built in package directory. See :help packages
